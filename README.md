The purpose of this web app, "UGAA Books Cloud," is to serve as a centralized digital library cloud that facilitates the collection and distribution of study materials for undergraduate students in Akkaraipattu. Its primary goals and functions include:

Material Collection: To collect and organize study materials, including books, notes, and past papers, from old students who no longer need them.

Material Distribution: To provide these study materials to current students who require them for their studies.

Membership System: To offer a membership system, allowing students to become members and borrow study materials as needed.

Resource Accessibility: To enable students to easily search for and access the study materials they require through an interactive database.

Cost Savings: To help students reduce the cost of printing study materials during challenging times.

Support and Guidance: To offer support and guidance to students in their studies, including study methods and resources.

Donation Initiative: To encourage the donation of old books and materials to further enrich the library's resources.

In summary, this web app aims to bridge the gap between students who have access to study materials and those who don't, making education more accessible and cost-effective for undergraduate students in Akkaraipattu.

Database is hosted on planet Scale hosting service and which is a MySQL database API which has a cool UI and console to manage the database.

Since this is a web app, the frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I built the frontend in the server-side using the handlebars template engine. The handlebars template engine is a simple templating language that allows us to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It is a logicless templating engine that separates the HTML structure from the logic. It is very easy to learn and use.
